## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unipluseducationact-ctrl/S3_Phy.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd S3_Phy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (with hot reload)
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173/** (Vite dev).

### Production Build

```bash
# Build static files to dist/ (includes plane-mirror-lab bundle step)
npm run build

# Rebuild Plane Mirror Lab only (labs/plane-mirror-lab → public/plane-mirror-lab)
npm run build:plane-mirror-lab

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

Preview serves the production build (usually **http://localhost:4173/**).

### Content Export Scripts (Maintainers)

```bash
npm run export:heat-flashcards
npm run export:light-flashcards
npm run export:optics-definitions-flashcards
```

## 🌐 Live Site & Deployment

**Live URL:** `https://unipluseducationact-ctrl.github.io/S3_PHY/`

If you still see a blank page, open `https://unipluseducationact-ctrl.github.io/S3_PHY/dist/` once, or configure Pages as below.

### Why the page was blank

GitHub was serving the **repository root** `index.html`, which loads `/src/main.js` for Vite dev. That file is not bundled for static hosting, so the app stayed empty.

**Fixes in this repo:**

1. **`dist/` is committed** with the production build.
2. **Root `index.html`** includes a redirect script that sends `*.github.io` visitors from `/S3_PHY/` to `/S3_PHY/dist/` until Pages points at `/dist` or Actions.
3. **`base: './'`** in `vite.config.js` so `./assets/...` works under `/S3_PHY/dist/` and when `/dist` contents are mapped to the site root.

**Option A — GitHub Actions (recommended):** Settings → Pages → **Source: GitHub Actions**. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds `dist/` and deploys via `upload-pages-artifact` + `deploy-pages`. Do **not** also use “Deploy from branch → `/dist`” — that second source races with Actions and causes intermittent deployment failures.

**Option B — Branch + `/dist` on `main`:** Settings → Pages → **Deploy from a branch** → Branch **`main`**, folder **`/dist`**. Disable or delete the GitHub Actions deploy workflow if you use this option only.

### Adding PDF Notes

Place files under `public/notes/` (see `public/notes/README.txt` for naming conventions).

```

### Build pipeline

1. **`npm run build:content`** — reads `manifest.json` in each package under `labs/`, `quizzes/`, and `worksheets/`, runs optional build scripts, and copies output into matching folders under `public/`.
2. **`npm run build`** — runs `build:content`, then `vite build` to produce `dist/` for deployment.
3. **Flashcard decks** live in `content/flashcards/data/` and are imported directly by the Vite app (not copied by `build:content`).
